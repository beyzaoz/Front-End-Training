        <h2>A Lost Day in Tokyo: Between Silence and Noise</h2>
        <img src="img\blog 1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The moment I stepped into Tokyo, I felt the city pull me in. On one side, neon lights flowing through crowds; on the other, the calm of ancient temples.
In the morning, I was lost in the human tide at Shibuya Crossing, and by the afternoon, I was walking through the quiet forest paths of Meiji Shrine, hearing nothing but birds.
When evening came, I found myself in a ramen bar, watching the city’s chaos while warming up with a hot bowl of ramen. Tokyo is one of those rare cities that lets you feel both chaos and peace at the same time.</p>

        <h2>Finding the Soul in Bali: Ubud’s Green Embrace</h2>
        <img src="img\blog2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Before my trip, everyone told me “Bali is another world,” and they were right.
Walking through Ubud’s rice terraces makes you feel like time has slowed down.
After morning yoga, I enjoyed a breakfast of fresh tropical fruits, met curious monkeys at the Monkey Forest, and watched the sky turn golden along Campuhan Ridge Walk at sunset.
Bali isn’t just a vacation—it's a gentle reset for the soul.</p>

        <h2>The Magic of Iceland: The Dance of Fire and Ice</h2>
        <img src="img\blog3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>On my first day in Iceland, driving through the black volcanic sands with massive ice formations rising in the distance completely mesmerized me.
Along the Golden Circle route, the explosive power of Geysir, the thunderous roar of Gullfoss, and the geological rifts of Thingvellir reminded me that the Earth is very much alive.
By evening, the clouds parted and the northern lights began to ripple across the sky like a soft green curtain.
Iceland teaches you how to fall in love with the world all over again</p>
