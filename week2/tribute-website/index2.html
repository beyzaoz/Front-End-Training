        <p>Born on February 25, 1907, in Eğridere, Gümülcine (located within today's Bulgarian borders), Sabahattin Ali, <br> spent his childhood in various cities across Anatolia due to his father’s military service. <br> Following his education at the Balıkesir and Istanbul Teachers' Colleges, he began his professional career as a teacher in Yozgat. <br> In 1928, he was sent to Germany by the Ministry of National Education, where he deepened his knowledge of the German language and European culture for two years. <br> Upon his return, he taught in cities like Aydın and Konya. During this period, he solidified his literary identity and <br> penned his first short stories, focusing on the life of the Anatolian people and their social issues.</p>

        <p>During the peak of his literary career, he became one of the most important representatives of the social realist movement in Turkish literature with novels <br> considered cornerstones of the genre, such as *Kuyucaklı Yusuf* (1937), *The Devil Inside Us* (*İçimizdeki Şeytan*, 1940) and especially *Madonna in a Fur Coat* (*Kürk Mantolu Madonna*, 1943). <br> In his novels and short stories, he masterfully explored the drama of ordinary people, social injustice, and the individual's inner <br> alienation. However, due to the critical tone and political stance in his works, <br> he faced oppression even while working in government institutions and was imprisoned in the 1930s on charges of insulting Atatürk. <br> Towards the late 1940s, his writings in political satire magazines, such as *Markopaşa*, <br> intensified the lawsuits and political pressure against him.</p>

        <p>As the pressure became unbearable and his opportunities for stable employment diminished, the author, in 1948, <br> decided to flee the country. During his attempt to cross the border into Bulgaria, <br> he was tragically murdered near Kırklareli on April 2, 1948, <br> by Ali Ertekin, the guide he had hired. His short life, which ended at the age of 41, <br> left behind a legacy of timeless works in Turkish literature, distinguished by their depth and social sensitivity. <br> Due to his tragic end, <br> Sabahattin Ali remains one of the most mournful and impactful figures <br> in Turkish literary history.</p>
