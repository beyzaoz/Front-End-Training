Creating an interactive Drum Kit website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Creating the HTML File:
Create an HTML file named index.html.

Add button elements for the keys to be used in your Drum Kit.

Assign a sound file (e.g., kick.wav, snare.wav) to each button.

2. Creating the CSS File:
Create a CSS file named style.css.

Style the Drum Kit buttons.

Make the button's appearance change when the user clicks on it (e.g., by adding a shadow).

3. Creating the JavaScript File:
Create a JavaScript file named script.js.

Listen for click events on the Drum Kit buttons.

When a user clicks a button, play the corresponding sound file.

Make the Drum Kit buttons also respond to keyboard key presses.
